# Flow Beat Generator - User Guide

## What is the Flow Beat Generator?

The Flow Beat Generator is a tool designed to help lyricists (rappers and singers) develop their flow and timing. It provides two synchronized metronomes:

1. **Steady Beat** - A reliable quarter-note foundation (like a drummer's kick drum)
2. **Flow Pattern** - A customizable rhythmic pattern that you write to (the "flow")

Together, they create the rhythmic framework that inspires your lyrical delivery.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Navigate to Flow Prompts
1. Select the **Lyricist** mode
2. Choose **Rapper** or **Singer** submode
3. Click ⚡ **Generate** to create a fuel pack
4. Scroll down to find the **Flow Prompts** card

### Step 2: Open Flow Beat Generator
1. Click the **🎵 Generate Flow Beats** button
2. A new overlay window opens with the generator interface

## The Two Metronomes

### Left Side: Steady Beat
This is your rhythmic foundation - think of it as a kick drum.

**Controls:**
- **BPM**: Set the tempo (40-240 beats per minute)
  - Typical rap: 90-110 BPM
  - Pop/R&B: 80-100 BPM
  - Hip-hop: 80-120 BPM
  - Trap: 120-150 BPM

- **Time Signature**: Choose your measure structure
  - **4/4** (most common): 4 beats per measure
  - **3/4**: 3 beats per measure (waltz-like)
  - **6/8**: 6 beats per measure (compound time)
  - **2/4**: 2 beats per measure (marching)

- **Beat Indicator**: Visual circles show which beat you're on
  - Glowing bright = active beat
  - Downbeats (1st beat) have a higher tone

**How to Use:**
1. Set BPM to your desired tempo
2. Choose a time signature that feels right
3. Click "▶️ Play Steady" to start the metronome
4. Use as your foundation while writing

### Right Side: Flow Pattern
This is your rhythmic groove - the pattern you'll write to.

**The Pattern Grid:**
Each box represents a beat in your pattern. The letters show note duration:
- **Q** = Quarter note (1 beat)
- **E** = Eighth note (half a beat)
- **S** = Sixteenth note (quarter of a beat)
- **H** = Half note (2 beats)

**Interactive Controls:**

1. **Change Note Length**
   - Click a note letter to cycle through durations
   - Example: Q → E → S → H → Q

2. **Add Silence** (🔇)
   - Click to toggle silence on a beat
   - Silenced beats still take up space but don't play
   - Red outline shows silenced beats

3. **Remove Beat** (✕)
   - Deletes a beat from the pattern
   - Disabled if only 1 beat remains

4. **Add Beat** (+)
   - Inserts a new quarter-note after the current beat

5. **Randomize** (🎲)
   - Quickly generates random note lengths and silences
   - Great for inspiration and experimentation

6. **Quantize** (📍)
   - Snaps all notes to quarter notes
   - Creates a perfectly aligned grid pattern
   - Useful if you accidentally made it too chaotic

**How to Create a Pattern:**

**Simple Grid Pattern (for beginners):**
1. Use default 4 quarter notes (Q Q Q Q)
2. Click one Q to change it to E (eighth note)
3. Play to hear the syncopation
4. Adjust as needed

**Syncopated Pattern (intermediate):**
1. Start with default Q Q Q Q
2. Change to: E S E Q S E (mix of lengths)
3. Add silences on 2nd and 4th beats
4. Result: Tricky, off-beat feel

**Experimental Pattern (advanced):**
1. Click "🎲 Random" multiple times
2. Play it to hear the pattern
3. Use 📍 Quantize to tighten it up if too chaotic
4. Tweak individual beats as needed

## Using Both Together

### The Magic: Layering

You can play both metronomes at the same time:

1. **Play Steady Beat**
   - Click "▶️ Play Steady" on the left

2. **Play Flow Pattern**
   - While steady is playing, click "▶️ Play Flow" on the right
   - Both play simultaneously

3. **Write to the Combination**
   - The steady beat provides structure
   - The flow pattern shows syncopation
   - Write lyrics that match the combined rhythm

### Typical Workflow

```
1. BPM: 100 (steady, neutral)
2. Time Sig: 4/4 (standard rap measure)
3. Flow: Q Q E E Q (bouncy rhythm)
4. Play both
5. Practice writing to the flow while steady grounds you
6. Adjust BPM or pattern based on feel
7. Save your favorite pattern (mentally or in notes)
```

## Tips & Tricks

### For Rappers
- Use **tight semantic**: Steady beat at 100-110 BPM with simple quarter notes
- Use **wild semantic**: Syncopated patterns with lots of eighths and sixteenths
- Add **silences** to create breathing room and emphasis

### For Singers
- Keep **steady beat consistent** for emotional grounding
- Use **slower BPM** (80-90) for ballads
- Create **flowing patterns** with mixed note lengths for natural phrasing

### Tempo Experiments
- **Too fast?** Lower the BPM before getting frustrated
- **Too slow?** Speed up gradually in 5 BPM increments
- **Finding groove?** Try BPM halfway between two tempos

### Pattern Inspiration
1. Start with **Quantize** to get a clean baseline
2. Then **Remove** one beat and **Add** an eighth-note pattern
3. Use **🎲 Random** to explore unexpected rhythms
4. Save the ones you like by remembering the layout

### Common Patterns to Try

**Hip-Hop Foundation:**
```
Q Q E E Q S S Q  (16-bar grid)
Solid, bouncy, trap-adjacent
```

**R&B Groove:**
```
E Q E Q E Q  (triplet feel)
Smooth, soulful, connected
```

**Urgent Delivery:**
```
S E S E Q  (fast syncopation)
Great for fast rap or aggressive vocals
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound?
- Make sure your computer speakers/headphones are on
- Browser may need permission to use audio
- Try clicking "Allow" if a browser prompt appears
- Refresh the page and try again

### Pattern Feels Off?
- Try using 📍 **Quantize** first to reset
- Experiment with different BPMs
- Try **🎲 Random** to get fresh ideas

### Steady Beat Doesn't Match Flow?
- Check that both are using the same or compatible BPMs
- Try rounding both to nearest 5 (e.g., 102 → 100)

### Can't Modify During Playback?
- This is intentional - stop the metronome first
- Click "⏹️ Stop" button to disable editing mode

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Polyrhythmic Layering
Set Flow BPM to 1.5x or 0.75x of Steady BPM for interesting cross-rhythms:
- Steady: 120 BPM
- Flow: 80 BPM (3-against-2 feel)

### Swing Practice
1. Create a simple quarter-note steady beat
2. Add swing to flow pattern with: Q E Q E
3. Practice phrasing across the swung feel

### Building Complexity
1. Start simple: Q Q Q Q (straight quarters)
2. Add one: Q Q E E Q (touch of syncopation)
3. Gradually: E S E Q S E (complex)
4. Repeat: Q Q Q Q (return to simple)

## Exit & Save

The Flow Beat Generator doesn't save patterns (yet!). To remember your favorites:
1. Take a screenshot or photo of the pattern
2. Write down: BPM, Time Sig, pattern sequence
3. Mentally rehearse the pattern
4. Notes: Describe the feel (e.g., "syncopated, urgent, triplet-based")
